# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began Javascript algorithm and data structures tutorial on freeCodeCamp. 46 tasks down.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good about passing these tasks with relative ease. Lots of refresher material from Odin Project Javascript track material. Looking back at responsive web design tutoruals I've already completed realizing that info probably hasn't stuck in my brain.....keep grinding.

### Day 2: June 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: More exercises on freeCodeCamp. Completed if Else statement "Golf Challenge". Actually began the 100 days of code log today, backfilled day 0 entry. Note to explore JavaScript30, Daily CSS Image Challenge, Udemy Web Developer bootcamp as possible resources to add to 100 day challenge.

**Thoughts** Today serves as a reminder of the need to practice! If else and switch statements seem intuitive but need to put in practice. Coding times today were 3:50pm-5pmish and agagin from 9:45pm-11:15pm

1. [Golf Code] 
var names = ["Hole-in-one!", "Eagle", "Birdie", "Par", "Bogey", "Double Bogey", "Go Home!"];
function golfScore(par, strokes) {
  // Only change code below this line
if (strokes == 1) {
  return names[0];
} else if (strokes <= (par - 2)) {
  return names[1];
} else if (strokes == (par - 1)) {
  return names[2];
} else if (strokes == par) {
  return names[3];
} else if (strokes == (par + 1)) {
  return names [4];
} else if (strokes == (par + 2)) {
  return names [5];
} else {
  return names [6];
}

  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(golfScore(5, 4));

### Day 3: June 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: FCC continued. Made a Trello board "Programming Guide" based on a recommendation from a completed 100 days of coder. 3p-5p / 9p-10p

**Thoughts** Taking notes this go round. Card counting function was a challenge. Enjoying Objects section of FCC JS course.

### Day 4: June 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Stupmed for an hour or two on record collection challenge. Followed various programming subreddits...can't escape even when procrastinating on reddit.

**Thoughts** Need to step back and evaluate challenges before aimlessly writing code. Over-complicating things. Revisit "record collection" to further grasp concepts.

### Day 5: June 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Back on FCC after Connecticut weekend. Started Loops.

### Day 7: June 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed FCC JS track (basic). Still confusion surrounding recursion - countdown & range of numbers difficulty. Begin ES6.

**Thoughts** Loops making sense sort of.
