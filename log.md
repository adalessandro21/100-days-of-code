# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: June 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Began Javascript algorithm and data structures tutorial on freeCodeCamp. 46 tasks down.

**Thoughts:** Feeling good about passing these tasks with relative ease. Lots of refresher material from Odin Project Javascript track material. Looking back at responsive web design tutoruals I've already completed realizing that info probably hasn't stuck in my brain.....keep grinding.

### Day 2: June 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
